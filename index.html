    <h1>Click the canvas! app</h1>

    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>My name is John Cely, I was born in Colombia and I've been developing software for seven years.</p>

    <h2>The solution</h2>
    <p>This is my solution for the geometrical shapes JS assignment.</p>
    
    <h3>The tools and APIs I used</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>TypeScript 3 as I think having types in a language is a great feature for writing more readable code.</li>
      <li>HTML 5 canvas API because I think it is the perfect fit for this kind of application.</li>
      <li>FabricJS is a library on top of the canvas API that provides a high level interface for painting, listening for events and updating the canvas.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How it works?</h2>
    <p>It's very easy, simply click on the grey space 3 times, each click will set a point. After the third point, the app will find a fourth one in such a way that they'll match the vertices of a parallelogram. A yellow circle will be painted. This circle will have the same area and center of mass as the parallelogram.</p>
    <p>After that you will be able to drag any point, and as you do it, a second point will also move causing the figure to remain a parallelogram. The circle will move and resize accordingly.</p>
